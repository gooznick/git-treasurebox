# Git TreasureBox

git puzzles.

## Purpose

This repo is a set of scripts that will create git repositories.

Each repository will have a "treasure" - a small text file with a quote.

The file is hidden in the git history/file structure/somewhere else in the git plumbing. You should find it.

The script that created the repository is visible.
